Kathryn Bannai,"Elaine Kim and Bill Tashima interviewed Kathryn Bannai. Kathryn Bannai was the lead counsel in Gordon Hirabayashi's coram nobis case (1983 – February 1985). Among other critical work, she successfully defeated the government's effort to dismiss Hirabayashi's case, which led to overturning Hirabayashi's convictions for resisting the curfew and exclusion orders promulgated under E.O. 9066. Bannai was Seattle JACL President in 1982 in a pivotal period for the Chapter. It was during this period that the Chapter expanded its work toward WWII Japanese American redress, aging and health issues for Issei and Nisei, and youth programming. Bannai also forged partnership with Japanese Canadians to share WWII experiences of injustice. Bannai was the only the third woman Chapter President and one of the earliest Sansei Chapter Presidents.

Theo reflected on one of the most meaningful events for which he helped coordinate which was alongside the Puyallup Valley JACL chapter the 75th anniversary of the Puyallup assembly center, ""Camp Harmony,"" an event that reconnected different generations of Japanese Americans to the site of Camp Harmony where many individuals shared stories which helps with healing through the trauma that incarceration created within the fairground during WWII. Theo shared his thoughts about the importance of the JACL and activism in the fight for justice and eradicating hate created by prejudice. The Seattle JACL chapter serves as a strong platform for making genuine connections with authentic individuals who are committed to enacting social change for the Japanese American, BIPOC and immigrant communities.

Yuriko Furubayashi,"Yuriko Furubayashi was born January 20, 1927, in Waimea, Hawai'i, as one of the ten children of the family. Her father had come to Hawai'i from Hiroshima in the mid-1910s as a contract worker on a pineapple plantation. He grew vegetables and kept chickens around the house to help feed the family. Her mother cooked Japanese food only in part because meat was hard to come by. Many of their co-workers on the plantation were Japanese, and Yuriko used to go to the after-school school at Hongan-ji with these co-workers' children. Her peers at the public school included Filipinos, Chinese, Polynesians, Portuguese, and Haoles. When she was ten years old, her uncle and aunt in Los Angeles, who had been successful owners of Olympic Hotel, took her to Japan. They were childless, so their plan was to make Yuriko the family's heir. Yuriko quickly adjusted to the life in Japan and graduated from high school. She was working in an airplane factory when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Although she was not injured, she was irradiated because she walked through the city on the day after to look for her aunt and uncle. The entire city was still on fire. She saw many corpses and people with severe nuclear burns. She lost one of her uncles to the bomb. She also visited her friend working at an orphanage, and was struck by how many children had lost their parents to the bomb. In 1948, she went to Hawai'i to see her parents, thanks to the arrangement made by her brother who had come to Japan as part of the US occupation force. She decided that she did not want to go back to Hiroshima where memories of the destruction ""depressed"" her. She studied to regain her English and worked at her sister's bakery near Kahoku. She married a baker, and they became successful owners of another bakery named after their oldest son. Yuriko was somewhat worried about radiation effect when she was pregnant with her first child. She gained hibakusha techo (certificate of survivorhood) issued by the Japanese government in the 1960s. She also regularly attends the biannual health checkups conducted by Japanese physicians for American survivors.",Yuriko Furubayashi Interview — ddr-densho-1021-7,"11-Jun-13.

Geri Handa,"Geri Handa was born in San Jose, California, in 1948, and studied in the early 1970s at the School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Los Angeles, with a focus on community organizing and social services for seniors. She joined Asians for Community Actions in San Jose and worked at Keiro Nursing Home in Los Angeles while she was still attending the school. In the early 1980s, Handa became involved with Friends of Hibakusha, a group created in support of US survivors of the atomic bombings. Since then, she has been one of the most active members of the organization. A Sansei, Handa has worked with Sansei lawyers and attorneys who took interest in US hibakusha from civil rights viewpoints, including Donald K. Tamaki whose oral history is part of this collection. She has worked with representatives of the Asian Law Alliances, the Asian Law Caucus, and the Japanese American Citizens League, in order to secure US government's recognition of US survivors. Although their effort ultimately failed, Handa says that it is ""remarkable"" that US survivors gained recognition and support for treating their radiation illnesses from the Japanese government. She has been a key organizer of the medical checkups conducted by Japanese physicians in San Francisco every other year since 1977. Throughout the interview, Handa emphasizes the importance of community engagement, multiculturalism, and lasting connections made through her work for US hibakusha.",Geri Handa Interview — ddr-densho-1021-2,"20-Jul-11.

Matsuko Hayashi,"Born in 1921 in Parlier in Fresno County, California, Matsuko Hayashi (pseudonym) grew up as the second oldest of the eight children of a first-generation immigrant who had come to the United States as a sixteen years old, and his wife who had come as a ""picture bride."" They raised grapes on three farms that Matsuko's father and his brother had bought. She remembers her father's affection for the family and his dedication to Buddhism, and how busy her mother was raising children. They hired Mexican laborers and operated their business successfully, winning many blue ribbons for their products at state fairs. Matsuko recalls how the family enjoyed going to camping at Yosemite, and how she went to a Japanese school on Saturdays and Sundays, which she found not effective in teaching her Japanese. As for the American school that she attended on weekdays, she recalls how her teachers were prejudiced against the Japanese. When she went to Japan in 1940, she felt her Japanese classmates were biased against Americans like herself. She and other Nisei at her school in Hiroshima spoke in English, making their Japanese classmate believe that the American students were bad-mouthing their Japanese peers. On August 8, 1945, she was injured and lost consciousness after the bombing, but she survived with the help of her Nisei friend that she knew from a sewing school she had attended in Hiroshima. She lost one of her sisters to the bombing, whom her family was able to identify only because of the white nametag she wore. After losing her Japanese husband to the war, Matsuko came back to the United States in 1947, went to a drapery school and worked in Hollywood as a dressmaker, and was remarried to a Nisei who had been a ""no-no-boy"" in Tule Lake and expressed no concern about the fact that Matsuko is a survivor. As a dedicated Buddhist, Matsuko spent her married life focusing on raising family and working at a nursery, and interacted with other US survivors only occasionally. She feels that being attacked by the bomb was like being hit by tsunami; it was shikata ga nai (It couldn't be helped).",Matsuko Hayashi Interview — ddr-densho-1021-4,"3-Jun-12.

He grew up as a typical Nisei, working summers in Alaska salmon canneries and Western Avenue produce brokerages to pay for his education. He became interested in writing at Garfield where he was sports editor of the school paper. While attending the University he worked at the weekly Japanese American Courier published by the late Jimmie Sakamoto. A faculty adviser at the University urged Hosokawa to drop out of the journalism school ""because no newspaper in the country would hire a Japanese boy."" Hosokawa rejected the advice, but when he graduated in 1937 he found the professor was right. After working as a male secretary writing letters, Hosokawa and his bride, the former Alice Miyake of Portland, Oregon, went to Singapore in 1938 to help launch an English language daily. A year and a half later Hosokawa moved to Shanghai to work on an American-owned monthly magazine, the Far Eastern Review. Then, sensing the inevitability of war, he returned to Seattle in 1941 just five weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor. When war came, Hosokawa served as executive director of Seattle JACL's Emergency Defense Council helping people in the community to cope. He and his family were removed to the Puyallup Assembly Center, Washington. When other Seattleites were moved to Minidoka concentration camp, Idaho, Hosokawa and his wife and infant son were sent to Heart Mountain, Wyoming. Later, he learned he had been separated from his Seattle friends because he was considered a potential troublemaker. He was in Heart Mountain for 14 months, working as editor of the camp newspaper, the Heart Mountain Sentinel, before being released to join the Des Moines, Iowa Register in 1943. In 1946 he moved to Denver to work on the Denver Post. In 38 years at The Post he held such assignments as executive news editor, assistant managing editor and Sunday editor. He covered the Japanese peace treaty in San Francisco in 1951, the Summit meeting in Paris in 1960 and the Zengakuren student riots in Japan that same year. He also had assignments as war correspondent in Korea and Vietnam, and for 17 years was editor of Empire, the Post's prize-winning Sunday magazine. For his last seven years at the Post Hosokawa was editor of the editorial page -- a Japanese American imprisoned during World War II as a potential security risk who now directed the opinion section of a major American newspaper. After retiring from the Post in 1984 he served the Rocky Mountain News as ombudsman columnist for seven years. Hosokawa has taught journalism classes at the University of Colorado, University of Northern Colorado and University of Wyoming. He wrote a weekly comment column called ""From the Frying Pan"" in JACL's weekly Pacific Citizen from 1942 until 1999. Among other honors, Hosokawa is a former president of the American Association of Sunday and Feature Editors and a member of that organization's Hall of Fame, a charter member of the Denver Press Club Hall of Fame. He was named JACL's Nisei of the Biennium in 1958, and has published 12 books.

Ray Ishii,"In this interview, Ana Tanaka and Joy Misako St. Germain led the conversation with Ray Ishii who served as the Seattle JACL President in 1994. Ray was first involved with JACL in the late 80's and early 90's encouraged by community leader Al Sugiyama and others, including Janice Deguchi and Joy Misako St. Germain, who encouraged Ray to run for the office of Seattle JACL President. Ray reflected on organized efforts at time, such as Initiative 200 to end affirmative action, and opposition against the gay and lesbian community. JACL was beginning to find new paths as a civil rights organization, such as collaborating and supporting the American Jewish Committee and the LGBTQIA community. The JACL membership was the powerful force then as it is today to rally the community on issues that impact everyone. JACL started to move beyond the focus on redress to work with other racial and ethnic communities and took the work to a new level, with younger leaders taking on leadership roles. As he and his family are Seattle natives, he expressed hope and gratitude for the recent work of JACL to support Black Lives Matter and on immigration issues. His work on the Pike Place Market Council and the progress seen in the area of minority and women owned businesses demonstrates how much impact volunteer work can have to make positive change. His parents' experiences. being incarcerated during WWII and his upbringing had a tremendous influence on his not taking for granted the importance of continuing the work of civil rights and social justice. He believes that the success of JACL is due to the ongoing commitment of the membership and leadership.",Ray Ishii Interview — ddr-sjacl-2-41,"21-Apr-22.0:36:39

Thomas T. Noguchi,"Thomas Noguchi was the first Japanese American to serve as the Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner of Los Angeles Country. Well-known for conducting autopsies of public figures such as Robert F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and William Holden, Noguchi was in the position between 1967 and 1982. As a Shin Issei immigrant born in Japan (in 1927) and trained in medicine in both Japan and the United States, Noguchi faced racial prejudice especially early in his career, leading to a dismissal from the position in 1969. The Japanese American community and organizations, including the Japanese American Citizens League, made a concerted effort to reinstate him, a campaign that proved successful. Noguchi felt ""grateful,"" and when US survivors ask for his assistance to organize themselves in 1970, he felt as if it was a good opportunity to give back to the community. He enlisted support for US hibakusha from the California State Senator Mervyn Dymally and the U.S. Congressman Edward Roybal. They authored the bills that would have established a publicly funded program for medical care and treatment of radiation illnesses among US survivors. Although both the state and federal bills failed, Noguchi's collaborative effort with the politicians of color reveal changing racial and class relations in the state and national politics in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Noguchi's interview includes a discussion of his work with key leaders of the US survivors' organization, his communication with the JACL, and the public hearings for the medical bills.",Thomas T.

Mika Kurose Ruthann,"Elaine Kim led a panel interview of Ruthann, Paul, and Mika Kurose. The conversation also touched upon reflections about Aki Kurose, Seattle teacher and peace activist who was Ruthann and Paul's mother, and Mika's grandmother, as well as about Junelow (Junx) whose love and support of Aki as her husband reinforces the incredible strength of the entire Kurose family in their multiple generations of community service and activism. Paul has made meaningful contributions as a teacher in the field of education, and represents the family in the annual JACL AKi Kurose college scholarships provided. Ruthann reflected on her lifetime work with civil rights and social justice included the importance of showing up and as John Lewis stated that ""when you see something is not right, not fair, not just, you have to speak up, say something, do something."" Mika shared her experiences working on President Obama's clemency initiative and the wide disparities between black and brown people and white people who are incarcerated in prisons for low-level, non-violent drug crimes and how this speaks to multiple societal, system issues including having little or no access to good schools or healthcare. There is much, ongoing work to be done and how building community coalitions and the values held by the Quakers, whom Aki Kurose was taught and influenced by, are those of pacifism and non-violent conflict resolution.",The Kurose Family Interview — ddr-sjacl-2-42,"23-Apr-22.1:28:12

Junji Sarashina,"Junji Sarashina was born in 1929 in Lahaina, Hawai'i, the son of a minister of a Buddhist Temple Nishihongan-ji and a teacher of Japanese-style flower arrangement, music, sewing, and cooking. The youngest of five children, Sarashina grew up surrounded by temple members (mostly plantation workers) and their families who enjoyed community picnics and samurai films. When his mother took her children to her hometown of Hiroshima in 1936, Sarashina struggled with Japanese at first. But soon, he got used to things Japanese thanks to the accommodations made by his mother, siblings, and schoolteachers. His older sisters baked Western style cakes and cookies and offered them to Sarashina's schoolmates, helping him to become better accepted. After the Pacific War began, Sarashina's family lost touch with his father who was still in Hawai'i. Later, he learned that his father had been taken by the FBI immediately after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He was sent to the US mainland, then to a number of different incarceration camps. Sarashina as a junior high school student was mobilized to work at an ammunition factory when the nuclear bomb struck Hiroshima. Although he was not injured, he was irradiated as he entered the city to return home. Sarashina suffered diarrhea and could not eat afterward. When he went back to Hawai'i in 1949, he attended high school again to relearn English. Soon, he found a job at a local radio station in Honolulu. During the Korean War, he volunteered to serve as a military intelligence officer. When he was sent to Korea, he was assigned to a unit led by a judo teacher he knew from Sawtelle, California. The teacher had been his older brother's schoolmate in Hiroshima, and so he took Sarashina under his wing throughout Sarashina's stay in Korea. Although Sarashina says that the American government could do more to support US hibakusha, he also says that he supports the medical checkups offered to American survivors by the Japanese government. In fact, he assisted the establishment of the checkup system in the early 1970s and continued to help the US hibakusha's organization called the American Society of Hiroshima-Nagasaki A-bomb Survivors. He takes pride in assisting many US survivors to obtain Japanese hibakusha techo (certificate of survivorhood) and to receive benefits.",Junji Sarashina Interview — ddr-densho-1021-5,"6-Jun-12.

Paul Satoh,"Born in Osaka, Japan, in 1936, Paul Satoh spent a happy childhood as the only child of a chemist and a homemaker. Satoh's extended family included an uncle who had studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his wife, a US-born Nikkei from Hawai'i who occasionally had received a ""care pack from the United States"" that she shared with the Satohs. Although the couple was not affected by the bomb as they were in Tokyo, one of Satoh's other aunts who was in Hiroshima died of radiation sickness. Satoh himself, too, was in Hiroshima as his family's house in Osaka was burned in an air raid early in 1945. Living in his relative's house in Koi, which was about six kilometer from the hypocenter, Satoh remembers hearing a ""real big sound"" at the moment of the explosion. His family decided to take refuge in his grandmother's house in the countryside, and as they walked through Hiroshima, they witnessed people dying on the street from severe burns and injuries. Many years later, his mother died of leukemia, while Satoh himself suffered from thyroid cancer. Immediately after the war, though, Satoh recalled only silence around the bomb, even as many of his classmates passed away because of the delayed radiation effect. He came to the United States in 1960 to study chemistry at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. He married a Polish American woman who was his classmate, and experienced racial discrimination in the era when interracial marriages were still illegal in many US states. Satoh also found that his brother-in-law had worked as a maintenance crew for Enola Gay, the airplane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. Satoh worked as a chemist in the for-profit sector, and he occasionally lectured at colleges on applied chemistry. Although he was not part of any US survivors' groups, he was interested in issues of nuclear weaponry and bomb victims. He has assisted research for a book written by his acquaintance about US prisoners of war who died of the bomb in Hiroshima in 1945.",Paul Satoh Interview — ddr-densho-1021-9,"23-Aug-15.

Keiko Shinmoto,"Keiko Shinmoto's father migrated from Hiroshima to Portland, Oregon, where his brother was an owner of a grocery store. After returning to Hiroshima to see his ailing father, Keiko's father found it impossible to return to America as his mother hid his passport to keep him in Japan. Shortly, Keiko's mother joined him in Hiroshima, also her hometown. Unlike her eight older siblings, then, Keiko was born in Japan, in 1936. She recalls the challenge of being sent to the countryside at the age of eight as part of shudan sokai, a wartime program for children aiming to protect the youth from fire bombings in cities. The food shortage and black market called yamiichi that flourished after the war, too, left Keiko a strong impression. She is a nyushi survivor, as she was exposed to radiation by walking through the city of Hiroshima three days after the bombing. She lost one of her older sisters to the bomb. She came to the United States in 1960 with a help of her US-born brother, by then living in Los Angeles. She relearned English from her father who was also back in the United States and in the area at that time. Keiko attended a technical college to study design while working as a ""schoolgirl"" and worked briefly in Beverly Hills as a dressmaker before she married Nisei from Stockton. A former prisoner of the Gila River War Relocation Center, he worked as a mechanic at Chevrolet after the war and became an owner of a car repair shop. Keiko helped the shop's book keeping, while she also raised two children and worked at a grocery store in order to pay for her health insurance. At the time of the interview, Keiko had just joined a biannual medical checkup conducted by Hiroshima physicians in San Francisco for the first time because of the encouragement by another US survivor. After her husband passed away in 1998, she has been enjoying talking with her children, going to a Buddhist church in Stockton, and keeping in touch with her Nisei friends.",Keiko Shinmoto Interview — ddr-densho-1021-3,"25-Jul-11.

Joy Misako S. Germain,"Ana Tanaka and Dr. Kyle Kinoshita led a conversation with Joy Misako St. Germain, detailing how she became involved with JACL and became a Seattle leader. Being one of just a few Japanese American families where she grew up, she felt a deep longing for a sense of community. Her love for Japanese American culture is one of the main factors that led to her moving to the Pacific Northwest. Joy was welcomed into the Seattle Chapter, and quickly became active. Chapter members were very encouraging, and soon she was active in the issues that JACL was engaged in during the 1990's. A clear leader who cared about the organization and was committed to their mission statement, she became chapter president. Joy helped establish many of the organizational structures that helped the Seattle Chapter sustain itself into a new century. Joy is optimistic about the newer generation of JACL activists and the work the organization has done to engage the younger generation. With the renewed focus of allyship with other communities and organizations, she feels as though everyone--the younger and older generations--can learn from each other as the JACL continues its work.",Joy Misako St. Germain Interview — ddr-sjacl-2-35,"2-Mar-22.0:50:59

Kathy Yamaguchi,"Kathy Yamaguchi (pseudonym) was born in 1948 as a Sansei daughter of a homemaker and a gardener, who had met in the incarceration camp in Topaz, Utah. Yamaguchi calls her father an ""assimilationist"" who mostly associated with non-Asians, and she feels that she, too, did not have a lot of Japanese American friends when she was growing up. When Yamaguchi began to pursue medical education at the University of California, San Francisco, in 1971, she realized how her lack of exposure to professional role models, as well as her experience of growing up in an extremely ""non-verbal"" family, made it a challenge for her to be in a decision-making position. She describes herself as being only ""around on the fringes"" of the Asian American activism in the 1970s. She joined the East Bay Socialist Doctors Group and the Physicians for Social Responsibility, and through members of these groups, she learned in the early 1980s about US survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. She was struck by their graciousness and gratefulness to physicians who offered the needed medical care. ""Given what they've gone through,"" Yamaguchi says, she felt it necessary to assist US hibakusha. She supports a single-payer health care system, and feels that US survivors are one of many groups that have been disadvantaged by the absence of such a system. Yamaguchi also enjoys working with Japanese physicians from Hiroshima who come biannually to conduct a health checkup for American hibakusha. She joined the Sansei Legacy Project beginning in 1990, which put her more in touch with her feelings about being raised by the parents who had been incarcerated during the war. She also made many more Japanese American friends through her participation in the group. At the time of the interview, Yamaguchi worked as a part-time physician in a public clinic serving the underserved patients in San Francisco's Japantown area.",Kathy Yamaguchi Interview — ddr-densho-1021-1,"15-Jul-11.
