        "The assignment facilitated practice with dealing with real-life complex scenarios, including airline bookings and inventories. Difficulty lay in dealing with integrity of data (processing edge cases such as overbooking and corrupting CSVs) and delivering a glitchless user experience. I liked dealing with feature implementations such as seat reservation, cancelation, and decomposition of a product category most. Appropriate time seemed to have been allocated, but beginners might require more time for dealing with error cases and with dealing with CSVs. To make it even better, additional complex features (search) and efficient checking for errors would make for a system and user function even better."
